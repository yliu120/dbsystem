##########################################################################

Features:

1) We implemented all the exercises except the indexed nested loop join.
2) We added a logger to the codebase since often times queries take a
   long time and we want to track where it is
3) We implements all the queries with only hash join. Since BNLJ is very
   slow even running with the small dataset.
4) We changed the codebase to fix some bugs:
   i) iterator bug: the same operator runs twice
   ii) index manager can't restore, no db.im file in the provide binary

Experiments:
1) Berkeley db: file -> hw2.sql 
                command to run: dbsql hw2.db < hw2.sql
2) Queries    : file -> hw2.py
                command to run: python3 hw2.py
3) Plot tools : plot.py

4) We provides some test files to test that each of our operators can
   work well separately. Combine operators into queries may cause errors.
   We don't have enough time to debug this.

Comments:

1) The code base is so slow that running a query needs time. This is not
   convenient for us to debug code. (especially project operator)
2) BNLJ is super slow that no experimental queries can work on that.
3) Sometimes python really works poorly on big dataset calculation.

Bugs:
1) BNLJ is super slow.
2) HashJoin loses data when combining with other itself.
