  # (Algorithm)
  #    Basically, we consider two situations
  #    i)  Alias of fields would be created during projection
  #    ii) Some fields may be projected out prior to join operators if they
  #        are directly pushed down.
  #    To resolve i) and ii),
  #    i) We traverse the tree to grab out all the fields and their alias.
  #    ii) When we visit a join operator, we marked the join conditions as
  #        required and we carry these information down
  #    
  #    After we correctly deal with i) and ii)
  #    For each relation (Tablescan), we invoke cost models to compute the
  #    selectivity of expressions regarding to the same field. We filter out
  #    some unnecessary expressions. Meanwhile, we will consider whether to serve
  #    selection or projection first for each relation.
