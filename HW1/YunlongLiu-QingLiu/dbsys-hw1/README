How to run our program?

For SlottedPage Workload Test:
./runSlottedPage

For PaxPage:
./runPaxPage

For Page:
./runPage


Attention:
1) Please use the API framework that we submitted. Since in
this version, we handled some typos in the original API.

Like: in the Storage/FileManager.py

Bug 1: removeRelation() -> rFile.path should be rFile.filePath
Bug 2: writePage( page ) -> there is no global pageId that can 
       be locally called.
...

2) Please check the timefig-SlottedPage.png as a sample result
we get from the tpch-sf0.1 dataset. We have limited time to run
data with the larger dataset.
